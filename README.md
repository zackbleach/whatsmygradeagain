=================

A simple grade calculator with which a user can answer the following questions:

  1. I got marks m1 - mn in n models. What mark do I need next year to get a 1st/2:1/2:2/3rd?
  2. I got x in this coursework which is worth y of course z. How how much do I need in the exam to get a 1st/2:1/2:2/3rd?
  3. I got marks m1 - mn in n models. Whats my current average Grade?
  
Currently, UI improvements needs to be made such that how to use the tool to answer 2. is more obvious.
